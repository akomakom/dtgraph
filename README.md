# DTGraph
Digitemp Graph - PHP graphing and data query framework for digitemp-style temperature readings

This project is free open source software (especially since it's written in 
PHP) and you should have received a copy of the Gnu Public License

What is DTGraph?
------------
Stands for DigiTemp Graph(ing tool).

Digitemp is an application for reading temperature from 1-wire 
sensors and is just one way of sensing/recording temperature.  It is not 
written by me, nor is it a part of this project.

The purpose of this project is to provide a number of ways of 
monitoring temperature that is already stored somewhere and even 
provide alerts for when things go astray.

PROJECT STATUS:
The Application works and (I think) is fairly useable. 

INSTALLATION:
Please see the INSTALL file.

UPGRADING:
Please see the UPGRADING file.

TODO:
change the mydigitemp.pl to be php, using same backend?
create alarm definitions table reflecting by class name per alarm type?
